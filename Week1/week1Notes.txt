Exploratory Data Analysis Principles - Analytic Graphics

1. Show Comparisons - Establish a baseline
2. Show causality/mechanism/explanation/systematic structure - explain with something! 
3. Show multivariate data - more than 2 variables and need to escape "flatland"
4. Integration of evidence
	do not let tools drive the analysis
5. Describe and document evidence with appropriate labels, scales, and sources
6. Content is king
	if you don't have a worthwhile message, all the analysis in the world won't help

Simpson's paradox - 
The pattern when data is combined is different than when the smaller group data trends
